# Statistics for Engineers @ SRECon 2019 Dublin

## Preparation

If you plan to attend the session and work on the Labs, please take a moment
to download the course materials before the sessions starts, so we don't
overwhelm the network:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/HeinrichHartmann/Statistics-for-Engineers.git
docker pull heinrichhartmann/jupyter
```

This will download ~1.8 GB of data.

## Agenda

The workshop will be split into two sessions, 90 minutes each.
The first session will focus on basic statistics, and it's application in the IT Operations domain.
The second section will has a focus on mergable data aggregation methods for latency data.

## Labs

At the end of each session there will (might) be some time for you to play with the material and/or work on labs.
The Labs can be found in the Labs sub-folder.
You are not expected to complete all of the Lab work within the session.
Just pick what is most interesting to you!
